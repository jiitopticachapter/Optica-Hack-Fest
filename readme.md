## What are Conventional Commits?

**Conventional Commits** is a commit message convention that provides an easy-to-follow, consistent way of writing meaningful commit messages. It helps maintainers quickly understand what each commit does and improves the overall development workflow.

### Conventional Commits Format

A Conventional Commit has the following format:

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Common Commit Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance changes that donâ€™t modify src or test files

### Example of a Conventional Commit
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login functionality"
```
This commit adds a new feature (`feat`) in the `auth` module, specifically the login functionality.

### Breaking Changes
For breaking changes, add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to the commit message:
```
feat(auth): change authentication method

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication method has been updated to OAuth 2.0. Previous tokens will no longer work.
```

3. **Push your changes** to your branch:
